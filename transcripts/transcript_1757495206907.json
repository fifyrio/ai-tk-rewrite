    "content": "Around two weeks ago, Google released a legendary image editor called Nano Banana that went pretty viral. It's so good at doing deep fakes, microediting photos, and doing all sorts of cool stuff. They've raised the bar pretty damn high. So, at least for me, I thought Nano Banana would be pretty hard to beat. Well, scratch that thought because we have a new image editor and generator which is even better. But don't take my word for it. I'll show you some examples in this video so you can decide for yourself. Anyways, Bite Dance, the company behind Tik Tok, just released Cadream 4.0. This is a state-of-the-art image generator and editor. So, in this video, I'm going to test the hell out of it and compare it with the leading image models out there, including Nano Banana. Plus, of course, I'm going to show you where to access this and how to use it. I'm going to link to this official page in the description below. Here are some of their official demos. It's really good at preserving the original style and character consistency. So, if this is your input image and you get it to generate three images from different views. The first one should be a 360Â° overhead view. Next, we have an elevated view. And then finally, we have a back view. Here is what we get. And this indeed preserves everything from the original photo. And it's also able to understand all these different camera perspectives. or you can feed it a logo like this and get it to create a set of visual designs for an outdoor sports brand. The products include packaging bags, hats, cards, etc., etc. And here is what you get. Indeed, it's able to completely preserve the logo design and the style and generate all these different products that are aligned with your brand's style. So, you know, this totally destroys graphic and product designers. Now, anyone can just plug in their logo or brand style and get this AI to generate different products or designs. Here's another insane example where you can upload a ton of different photos and merge all of them together into one photo. So, here's the prompt below and here is your final output. It understands the prompt extremely well. Plus, everything looks exactly like the reference objects that were uploaded. Or we can also take this poster and change the text into sea dream photography exhibition and also change the dates like this. Or we can completely change the lighting of the scene to something like this. How cool is that? Or we can also take this really rough sketch and generate someone playing tennis. Or we can change this dog into another breed while preserving the pose and the rest of this photo. It's also extremely good at colorizing black and white photos. As you can see in this example, it's also extremely good at style transfer. So, let's say this is your input image. Well, you can change the style of the text into bronze or knitted or origami or building blocks like this. Or here's another example where we can take this input image and convert it into many different art styles. Now, instead of just editing images, this is also extremely good at just generating images, including posters and diagrams with text. So, this has really good world understanding just like the legendary GPT40 image model. For example, you can get it to design a landing page for this gallery like this. Or here's another crazier example here. You can prompt it to draw out the following equation on the blackboard and also draw out the corresponding solution. So, here it draws out the original formula and this is an image of a blackboard and then it proceeds to solve the equation. How crazy is that? This is just an image generator, but it's able to generate this. So, as I'll show you in a second, its image generation capabilities, and notice I'm talking about generation, not editing. It's even better than GPT40. Here's another crazy example where you can get it to draw a timeline of all these Chinese dynasties in clear order, followed by a small icon and the characteristics of each dynasty. It's really good at world understanding. So, you know, this also has the potential to disrupt Canva. You no longer need to manually copy and paste these photos and add all this text and design everything yourself. In just a few seconds, you can generate a complete design of pretty much any topic with this AI. Or here's another example where you can get it to draw a poster to help people understand the harm of staying up late. And here's what the poster looks like. Here's another crazy example. Here's the prompt. in a handwritten journal style. Create a tutorial for ice cream making steps. And here is what you get. Notice that the text and the diagrams are completely correct. Here's another crazy example. You can get it to draw a chart showing the typical vegetation in four different climate zones. And here's what you get. So, we're no longer limited to just creating, you know, like photography style images. With this AI, you can easily create diagrams and infographics and PowerPoint slides. This is incredibly powerful. Now, those are just some of their examples, so you know, they might be cherrypicked. Next, I'm going to show you some of my generations. All right, so first I wanted to test how good it is at character consistency. So, here I've uploaded two characters with pretty complicated designs. Try to remember the intricate design of this character as well as this character. And then I also added this rough pose drawing. And then for the prompt, I simply put make the characters fight according to the pose drawing. They are fighting in an arctic background with a blizzard. And here's what I got from Seamream. Notice that for the most part, both characters look exactly like the reference images. Notice the patterns on this guy's armor are aligned with this photo. Same with the details of this woman's armor. Notice that everything is the same as my input photo, including, you know, these golden designs all across her armor. If you want, you can pause the video to confirm and the pose is also aligned with my drawing. Now, in contrast, here's GPT40. Notice that the characters don't even look close to what I uploaded. Plus, the pose is also messed up. And then here's Nano Banana. Even though Nano Banana is really good at character consistency, so the characters do look the same as my reference photos, but the pose is kind of off. So, as you can see, at least in this example, Seamream is the winner. Here's another really impressive example. I uploaded this aerial photo of a city, and I simply prompted it to turn it into nighttime. Notice that for Cadream, it pretty much aced this transition while keeping all the details from this original photo intact. You can pause the video if you want, but basically all the buildings and all the details are exactly the same as the input photo. It's just that it turned this from day to night. By the way, for all these generations, I took the best of four. Unfortunately, for Nano Banana, it was not able to come close to turning this into a nighttime photo like C3rink. And then for GPT, although it was able to turn it into nighttime, the details are all messed up. So, it changed a lot of things compared to the original photo. Again, in this example, Cadream is the clear winner. Now, I also did the reverse. So, I tried to change a photo from nighttime to day, but that's too easy. So, let's also add a massive explosion in the background. For your reference, here's what I got from Cadream. Notice that again, it keeps everything intact, and it also knows to turn off the street lamps because it is daytime. And indeed, it adds a massive explosion in the background. Notice that it keeps all the details intact, including these electric lines at the top here, including this couple holding an umbrella. This tram also looks exactly the same as the input photo. Now, if you compare this with the other two image models for GPT, it was able to turn this into daytime and add a massive explosion, but it just changed a lot of details from the original photo. So, that's a fail. And then for Nano Banana, again, it's not really good at turning things from day to night or vice versa. Here you can see the street lamps are still on, plus the road reflection doesn't really match the sky. And even the explosion in the background looks a bit off. So, at least in this instance, I would say the point again goes to Cadream 4.0. Here's another thing that Cream is really good at. It actually understands different camera perspectives and angles. So, for example, here is my input photo. And for the prompt, I want to make a fisheye overhead view of this scene. And here's what I got from Cadream. Notice that it does make an overhead fisheye view of this scene. Also, notice that the details of this woman are exactly the same as the original photo. And then here's GPT's generation. It can kind of create a fisheye view, but it kind of went too overboard. And as you can see, the details are all messed up. her face, her shirt doesn't even look close to the original photo. So, in terms of image editing, I find that GPT just changes too many things from the original photo. And then for Nano Banana, it came close. So, it was kind of able to zoom out a bit and also kind of generates an overhead view, although it's not as overhead as Seam. Unfortunately, this isn't really a fisheye perspective. So, for fisheye, it should look more like this, where the edges are kind of distorted. So in this example in terms of understanding the prompt again I would have to give the point to Seadream. And then here's another example instead of fisheye I tried to get it to generate an ultra wide angle shot of the scene taken from below. And again Seream was able to nail this. This is the same scene taken from below and it is an ultra wide perspective. For GPT it was not able to generate an ultra wide angle nor was able to change the perspective from below. For Nano Banana, it was also not able to change the camera angle from below. Plus, I would argue that this isn't even an ultra wide perspective. Like, if you compare this with Cream's Generation, this looks way wider. And you know, the impressive thing is not only was it able to preserve this woman, but if you notice the characters at the back, such as this dude with a white t-shirt and this woman with a pink backpack, etc., etc., these people are still preserved in Cadream's generation. So, it's really good at preserving the details of your input image. Again, here the point goes to Cadream. All right, here's an even crazier test. So, basically, I went to Google Maps and then I just found a random place somewhere in Macau and then I turned on satellite view and then I took a screenshot of this place and sent that as the input image. And then for the prompt, I put make a photo of the front of this building, wide-angle shot. And for your reference, here's the street view of this building. So it looks like this in real life. So here it's really testing the model's world understanding from just a Google map photo. Can it actually understand what this building is and generate the front of this building? And then for your reference, I also pasted the real street view over here. For Cream 4, it pretty much nailed this. It generated a wide-angle photo that looks really similar to the actual front of the building. Super impressive. Now for Nano Banana. Actually, I was expecting it to ace this because Nano Banana is from Google, which owns Google Maps and Google Street View. So, I was expecting it to understand what this building is and generate the front of this building. But unfortunately, it did not generate anything close to the real thing. And then here's GPT's generation. Surprisingly, it came pretty close, but the details are kind of messed up. So, for example, notice that for the building here, there are two different levels to its roof, whereas here, it only generated one. Notice that the golden part also only goes up to here. So, GPT's generation was not correct over here. However, Cream was actually able to ace this. This is really impressive. Now, if you've been following my channel, I've basically tested out all the best image models out there, and you might have noticed that my prompts are getting harder and harder, and that's because these image models are getting better and better. So, here's another really crazy prompt, which I don't expect any model to get fully correct. But anyways, here I've uploaded this image of a woman. And I basically got the model to create a fashion mood board collage. It should generate a portrait of the person surrounded with cutouts of the individual items the model is wearing. Add handwritten notes and sketches in a playful marker style font and include the name of each item in English. So, here's Seamream's generation. This is actually extremely good. So, it indeed cloned this woman. She looks exactly the same as the input photo. And then it's surrounded by cutouts of everything that she's wearing. Plus, the labels are all correct. So, here indeed is this maroon leather jacket. And notice that the details of this jacket are completely aligned with this input image. And then here is a thick beige knit scarf. Very nice. Here we have a teal and gold plate midi skirt which is also correct and this also looks exactly like the skirt here. Plus we have a tan crossbody bag which is also correct. And then plus we have some random sketches all across this mood board. Pretty damn good. I would say one error is that this coffee cup is not really labeled beside this coffee cup. Plus there's an extra cup here. Plus there is some gibberish throughout this generation. But overall it's not too bad. that. And then if you look at GPT's generation, it completely changed the look of this woman. Plus, it just decided to cartoonize everything. So, unfortunately, this was a fail. And then here's Nano Bananas Generation. You know, for the most part, it's not bad. So, it was also able to add cutouts of all the items that this person is wearing. And it is in marker font. However, there are a few more errors in this generation compared to Sadream. So, for example, the bag isn't actually pointing to the bag over here, and then the skirt is also not labeled. Plus, I don't know why it decided to add boots here, even though the original image isn't showing any boots. So, I mean, if you compare Cadream with Nano Banana, according to what I prompted, Cadream does look a bit better. Notice that I explicitly wanted handwritten notes and sketches. So, Cadream looks more handwritten. Plus, this looks more like a cutout collage, whereas Nano Banana looks too digital. But let me know in the comments what you think. Speaking of AI tools, you've got to check out LTX Studio, the sponsor of this video.

Note that LTXV was trained on licensed Getty Images and Shuttertock data sets and it allows for free commercial use for most businesses. LTX Studio is the ultimate choice for anyone looking to create AI videos with ease. Definitely check it out via the link in the description below. All right, next. Here's another test on how good it is at style transfer. So, here's my input image. And basically, I wanted to change the text to puggles and turn the bear into a pug while keeping the same style. And here's what I got from Seamream. Again, it was able to preserve everything, but change the text into puggles and turn this bear into a pug. Here's what I got from GPT. And again, GPT tends to slightly change everything in the photo. So, this is a fail. Like the flowers and the hearts surrounding this character are all slightly different from the original photo. And then here's what I got from Nano Banana. I guess Nano Banana followed my prompt a bit too literally in that it changed the bear to a pug while keeping, you know, the color and the pose, whereas I didn't really want a red pug. So, actually, I preferred Sea Dreams Generation, but you could argue that Nano Banana was more accurate in preserving, you know, the color and the pose of this bear. So, I guess for this one, it's a bit subjective, but let me know in the comments which one you prefer. Here's another test on how good it is at changing the text and design of something while keeping the original style. So, here's my input image. And I wanted to change the text into the great annual sports day instead of bake off and then change the venue to main stadium and change the images to be sports related. So, here's what I got from Cadream and it followed my instructions really well. It changed bake off to sports day. Plus, it changed the venue to main stadium. Plus, it changed the images to be sports related. So, you can see with this tool, it's now extremely easy to create posters. You can just take an existing poster which you want to copy the style of, and then plug it through this AI to generate a new poster. Here's GPT's generation. You can see the design is already a bit off. So, the text should be under the design, not above it. So, that's a fail. Plus, some of these sports items don't even look accurate. And then here's Nano Banana's generation. It was also able to pull this off really well. However, strangely for this venue here, it's not really center aligned. I suspect that's because in the original image, venue starts over here. So, it's just changing the text here and not center aligning the text. So, in that case, I would have to prefer Cadream a bit more. It actually knows to center align everything after changing the venue. But honestly, both of these generations are not bad. All right, here's another example which I suspect Seamream would be really good at. So, here's my original poster. And basically, for the prompt, I wanted to turn all the text into Chinese. And Cadream pretty much ate this. So, all the Chinese is correct. This is so damn good. Notice that it also preserves the font of the original image, plus the details of everything else are all intact. And then here is GPT's generation. Unfortunately, it changed a lot of details. Plus, the Chinese isn't even correct. Some of these characters don't even exist. And then for Nano Banana, it was not able to translate everything into Chinese. Plus, most of these characters also don't exist. So, in terms of translating the text in an image, Cadream is the clear winner in this case. Here's another test. So, here's my input image. I wanted to swap the outfits of the humans and then turn the pig's head into a chicken's head. And here's what I got for Cedri. It pretty much nailed this. It was able to swap the outfits of these two characters, plus turn this pig's head into a chicken's head like this. It was even able to preserve, you know, the eyes of this pig and apply it to the chicken. This is really impressive. Here's GPT's generation. It was not able to swap the outfits. Plus, it added an extra chicken's head over here. And then here's Nano Banana's generation. It was able to swap the outfits, but there's a slight flaw over here where you can still kind of see the green kimono. Plus, I would argue that the style of the chicken from Sadream does look more aligned with the input image, especially the eyes, whereas for Nano Banana, it just added a chicken that looks completely different. So, it's a close call. Let me know in the comments which one you prefer. Next, here's a fun one. So, here's my input image. And for the prompt, I wanted to swap the race of the husband and the wife. So, here's what I got from Seamream. And you can see this is really good. It actually swapped the races. Plus, it kept all the facial details intact. Especially if you look at the husband, his facial features look exactly the same as the input image. It's just that now he's turned white. Here's GPT's generation. It was not able to swap the races. It just swapped their positions. Plus, it added this extra kid. And then here is Nano Banana. it was able to swap the races. But notice that the faces don't look the same as the original image, especially if you look at the husband. He looks completely different from the original husband, whereas Cadream was actually able to preserve the facial features. So in this example, again, I would have to say the point goes to Cadream. Next up, here's a test on photo restoration and colorization. So I've uploaded a really old photo which has folds and damages all over it. Plus, the edges are kind of fading. And for the prompt, I just wanted to get it to restore and colorize this photo. And here's what I got from Cream. Notice that it was able to remove all these folds and scratches and damages, plus the fade along the edges of the original photo. Plus, all the facial features are aligned with the people in the input image. Like, you can pause the video and compare the before and after, and the faces do look the same. For GPT, it just changed all of their faces. So, this was an instant fail. And then for Nano Banana, it was also able to preserve their facial features, but notice that it was not able to fix the fade along the edges of the photo. Right? You can see that the colors kind of fade at the bottom over here. Whereas for Cadream, it was also able to fix the fade. Plus, the colors of Nano Banana's Generation do look a bit more faded. So, it's a close call, but at least for me, I would slightly prefer Seamream's generation. Let me know in the comments what you think. And then next, here is a test on style transfer. So, here's my original image. I just wanted to turn it into anime style. And here's what I got from Cream. It was able to turn this into anime style. Plus, the items on this table and over here are also preserved in Cadream's generation. This is really good. And then here are the generations from GPT and Nano Banana. As you can see, both of them failed to generate a decent looking anime photo from my input image. So in terms of turning something into anime style, Cadream is the clear winner. Here's another test that I tried out. So here is the original image. And I wanted to turn all the designs into dark mode. Here's what I got from Seamream's generation. It was able to preserve most of the large text. So all the numbers are preserved plus jump rope and dumbbell boot camp plus Eliza Beckett are preserved. However, notice that for the small text over here, it's completely messed up. So that is Cdream's generation for GPT. Again, it just changed way too many details of the image. So that's a complete fail. And then here is Nano Banana's generation. This is actually really impressive. It was able to change everything into dark mode. Plus the text is also preserved way better than Cream. So you can clearly read that this says feed friends groups ECG today coach you. Whereas for Cdreams generation all this text is kind of messed up. So at least in this example I would have to give the point to Nano Banana. All right. Here's another really tricky prompt. I used this Destiny Gundam as the input image and then I wanted to get it to make a model sheet of this character with a front, back, and side view. Here is Cadream's generation. For this back view, the wings aren't exactly correct. Plus, for the side view, we don't see it hold a gun from the original photo. Whereas for Nano Banana, the wings do look more correct. Plus, it is holding the gun in the side view. However, what I kind of like about Seamream's generation is that if you look closely, attached to its back are actually two different guns or swords. So we have this white handle here plus this green handle over here. And then for Seamream, at least for two of these views, it includes the green gun. Whereas for Nano Banana, it completely removed this green handle. So that's a slight flaw with Nano Banana. And then for GPT's generation, it just messed up a ton of details. Plus, it's missing wings here. So it's a complete fail in this instance. It's kind of a close call between Cadream and Nano Banana. None of them got it completely perfect. So each of them have their own flaws. So I would say it's a tie in this example. Now like I mentioned at the beginning, Cream 4 is not just an image editor. This is also an image generator. So this can just create images with a text prompt. I would argue it's even better than the legendary GPT40. So here are some image generation tests. And notice that here I don't have Nano Banana because Nano Banana isn't actually that good of an image generator. It's just good at editing existing images. So instead I swapped it out for Google's even better image generator imagine 4. And then here the prompt is a diagram showing the water cycle. And then here is Cream's generation. You can see for the most part it got all the information correct. Now notice that this is the best out of four generations. So you know three out of the four generations had some errors but this fourth one was the most correct. So indeed we have evaporation and then condensation into a cloud and then it rains which is precipitation and then this accumulates into runoff I guess and then the cycle repeats again and again. Notice that all the text is correct. And then here's GPT's generation. It's actually pretty bad at generating a diagram of the water cycle. So it's lacking a lot of details. Plus this diagram isn't even correct. And then here is imagine 4. It's not bad. like it got most of the elements, but some parts are kind of weird, like these arrows over here. So, in this instance, I would have to give the point to Cadream. And then here's another example where I got it to make a poster explaining the benefits of coffee. So, here's Cadream's generation. Most of the text is correct except that it added an extra hyphen over here, plus an extra dot on the eye over here. But for the most part, it understood what I was prompting it. It actually generated a poster with accurate info on the benefits of coffee. And then here's imagine four's generation. It's not too bad, but this cup has two handles. So this diagram isn't really correct. And then there are some slight misspellings in the text like over here. And then for GPT, this is pretty good. So it got all of the text correct plus the diagrams are also kind of correct. Notice that for GPT, I forgot to set the aspect ratio to 1 one. So that's why this image is vertical like this. All right, here's a fun example which I did not expect any model to get completely correct. I wanted to see if it can help me do homework. So here is a screenshot of this cell and we need to basically label all these organels. So for the prompt I wrote add the correct labels to the organels. For Cadream, it was able to actually name and spell most organels correctly, but some of the labels are not correct. And then here are the generations from GPT and Nano Banana. So for GPT, it was also able to spell most of the organels correctly, but the labels were also wrong. And then for Nano Banana, it had a lot more misspellings, plus the labels were also wrong. So none of them got it completely correct. So that sums up my tests on Cadream and comparing it with the best image models out there including Nano Banana, Imagine 4 and GPT. Cream is not perfect, but as you can see in most of my examples, Cream is a bit better. It has really good world understanding and also really good understanding of different camera perspectives. Plus, it's really good at micro editing and preserving all the details of my input images. All right, by now I'm sure you're dying to know where you can access Cadream 4.0. Now, at the time of this recording, there are already many platforms that offer access to Cream 4. So, FAI is one of them. I'll link to this page in the description below. And then, Replicate has also released a space where you can use Cedream. Notice that all these platforms are paid. So, for example, for Replicate, it costs roughly 3 cents per image. Now, if you go to Bite Dance's native image and video generation platform called Dreamina, at least for the English version, they currently don't have Cream 4.0 yet, at least at the time of this recording. However, you can access Cream 4.0 using the Chinese version of this platform. It's called Gmong, and I'll also link to this in the description below. You can sign up for free and you get a few dozen free daily credits which you can use for a few generations. Again, let me translate to English. And then if you don't see this on the left here, you can also click on this generate icon. And then down here is where you can start generating images. So here is where you can upload an image or you can just drag and drop an image onto here to edit. Or of course, this can also work without an image. You can just generate an image from scratch using a text prompt. So here's where you would add your prompt. And then down here you would select this one for image generation. And then here is basically the model dropdown. So yes, we are going to select this latest one which is powered by Cream 4.0. And then here is where you would select the aspect ratio. So you can choose from all these aspect ratios. And notice that you can generate photos in 2K resolution. Anyways, that sums up my review on Seance 4.0. And at least from my initial tests, this does seem to marginally beat Nano Banana in most tasks. I can't believe in just a span of two weeks, we already have something that beats Nano Banana. But here you go. Let me know in the comments what you think of this. And if you've had a chance to play around with Seedream, what other cool and impressive things were you able to get it to do?
