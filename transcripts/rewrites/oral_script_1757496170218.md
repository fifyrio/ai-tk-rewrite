# 口播脚本 (Oral Presentation Script)

- **话题建议**: Based on your research on AI image generators, here's a content idea that matches the exact topic but offers fresh value:

**"I Tested Nano Banana vs GPT-4o vs Seedream 4.0: The Ultimate Speed & Cost Battle for Creative Professionals"**

This content idea maintains the exact same niche (AI image generation tools comparison) and features the same specific tools mentioned in your research, but shifts the focus from general capability comparisons to a **data-driven efficiency analysis**. 

**Why this stands out:**

- **Specific Testing Framework**: Instead of general feature showcases, focus on timed challenges with real creative briefs (logo design in under 2 minutes, character consistency across 5 iterations, etc.)

- **Cost-Per-Output Analysis**: Break down the actual cost of producing professional-quality results with each tool, including failed attempts and revision time

- **Professional Workflow Integration**: Test how each tool performs in actual creative workflows (social media content creation, client presentations, marketing materials)

- **Quantified Results**: Present clear winners in specific categories with actual numbers (processing time, cost per image, success rate percentages)

This approach appeals to the same audience (creative professionals and tech enthusiasts) but provides actionable, data-driven insights they can use for business decisions rather than just feature awareness. The "battle" format with specific metrics creates engaging, shareable content while delivering practical value for professionals choosing between these tools.
